```

---

## üìå Key Terminologies

- **Control Node / Managed Node**  
  Server which runs the Ansible application

- **Modules**  
  A module is a command meant to be executed on the client side

- **Task**  
  A task is a section that consists of a single procedure to be completed. A task can include multiple modules

- **Playbook**  
  Automation file with step-by-step execution of multiple tasks

- **YAML**  
  Playbooks are written in YAML syntax

- **Inventory**  
  File that has information about remote clients where tasks are executed

- **Tag**  
  A reference or alias to a task

- **Variables**  
  Containers that hold defined values which can be reused

- **Role**  
  Splitting of playbooks into smaller groups. Roles let you automatically load related variables, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Ansible Works

- Each specific task is written using a module  
- Multiple modules are written in sequential order  
- A group of related modules forms a **Play**  
- All plays together form a **Playbook**

---

## üíª Useful Commands

```bash
ansible-playbook example.yml         # Run a playbook

ansible myservers -m ping            # Run a module independently
```

## üìÇ Important Ansible Configuration Files

```text
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg     # Main Ansible configuration file
/etc/ansible/hosts           # Inventory file for hosts
/etc/ansible/roles           # Directory for roles
```

### Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if pip is installed
python3 -m pip -V   

# If pip is not installed
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py --user

# Install Ansible
python3 -m pip install --user ansible

# OR install minimal version
python3 -m pip install --user ansible-core

# OR install specific version
python3 -m pip install --user ansible-core==2.12.3

# Upgrade Ansible
python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible
```

> üìå If SELinux is enabled on remote nodes, install the `libselinux-python` package.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è YAML Essentials

- All tasks are executed sequentially
- Indentation is extremely important
- **Do not use tabs**, only use spaces
- Empty lines have no value
- File extension should be `.yml` or `.yaml`
- Quotes around task names are optional

---

## üìÑ Sample YAML

```yaml
name: sampleplaybook  # Playbook name
hosts: all            # Where to run
become: yes           # Run as a different user
become_user: root

tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present

  - name: Start Apache service
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
```

---

## üìù Sample Playbook

```yaml
name: "First Playbook"
hosts: all
tasks: 
  - name: "Test Connectivity"
    ping:
```

---

## üîç Syntax & Playbook Execution

```bash
ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml   # Check syntax
ansible-playbook --check playbook.yml          # Dry run
ansible-playbook path/to/playbook.yml          # Run playbook

ansible             # Run Ansible without playbook
ansible-playbook    # Run Ansible with playbook
```
